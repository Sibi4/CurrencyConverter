This project is structured in different components:

- MainPage where all other components are imported. 
- Header component
- FromCurrencyComponent
- ToCurrencyComponent

I have used react hooks like: 
- useContext() to return context values
- userEffect() to run the effects after every render
- useState() to preserve a state before components
